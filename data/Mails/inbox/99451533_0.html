Hi John,

ImageCon 2018 <http://email.cloudinary.com/q1009Lx01kLB00R1o0ydwF0000S0R> is only two and a half weeks away, but you still have time to register! And, all ticket sale proceeds from ImageCon 2018 will be donated to Women Who Code, a global nonprofit dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers.

Cloudinary launched the first annual ImageCon last year with the aim of hosting a day where people could come together on all things digital media, and this year's conference will be bigger and better than before. Join other innovative developers and creators to share tips, tricks and tools for managing images, video and other forms of media on April 12th at the Four Seasons in San Francisco. 

 Here are a few things you can expect from ImageCon 2018:

+ Learn from the best of the best – leaders at Akamai, Archlogic, Big Medium, Cloudinary, Etsy, Pinterest and other top companies will be sharing their insights and best practices
+ Arm yourself with practical knowledge – come back to the office with actionable insights that enable you, and your colleagues, to work more efficiently
+ Stay ahead of the curve – gain a deeper understanding of trends in machine learning, web performance and how VR and AR could impact your organization
+ Get your party on – close out your day with a fun and engaging dinner where you can mix and mingle with like-minded folks in the industry, and maybe make a new friend or two


Time is running out, and you won't want to miss it. We hope to see you there!
