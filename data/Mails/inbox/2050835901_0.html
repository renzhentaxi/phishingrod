Hey John,

If your websites or app supports user uploaded images (and other files) - our Upload Widget <http://email.cloudinary.com/P00090FLyR0wEo0F0RSB1d1> may be exactly what youâ€™re looking for!
By adding a single line of JavaScript code to your site, you will have a complete UI <http://email.cloudinary.com/iTFL09R1wFy00F000Rd1B0o> that allows users to interactively upload images and any other files to the cloud directly from their web browsers; including interactively selecting images from various 3rd party sources such as Facebook, Google Photos, Dropbox or even Google Image Search.




Check it out and let us know what you think :)



Thanks!
Roseann
